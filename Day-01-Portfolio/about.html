      <h1>Hello from Aman Memon!</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Master of Computer Applications student at NIT Raipur with a
          strong passion for software development and problem-solving. Coming
          from a commerce background, I made a deliberate transition into
          technology, overcoming academic gaps through discipline, consistency,
          and self-driven learning—an effort that led me to successfully clear
          the NIMCET exam. I enjoy working with data structures, algorithms, and
          building efficient solutions, and I actively practice coding to
          sharpen my technical skills. Alongside technical growth, I focus on
          improving communication and soft skills to present ideas clearly and
          confidently. I aspire to build a career as a software developer where
          I can continuously learn, create impactful solutions, and grow as a
          professional.
